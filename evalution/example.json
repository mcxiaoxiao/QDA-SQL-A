We can do this by joining the `Student_Enrolment` and `Semesters` tables on the `semester_id` column, and then grouping by the `semester_id` and `semester_name` columns. We can then use the `MIN` aggregate function to find the minimum number of enrolled students for each semester.\n\nHere is the SQL query to find the semester with the least number of students:\n```\nSELECT s.semester_id, s.semester_name, COUNT(se.student_id) AS num_enrolled\nFROM Semesters s\nJOIN Student_Enrolment se ON s.semester_id = se.semester_id\nGROUP BY s.semester_id, s.semester_name\nORDER BY num_enrolled ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis query will return the `semester_id`, `semester_name`, and the number of enrolled students for each semester, sorted by the number of enrolled students in ascending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to only return the first row, which is the semester with the least number of enrolled students.\n\nFor example, if the query returns the following result:"}, {"isUser": true, "text": "How about the semester that most number of students registered?"}, {"isUser": false, "query": "SELECT T1.semester_name ,  T1.semester_id FROM Semesters AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.semester_id  =  T2.semester_id GROUP BY T1.semester_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1", "predict": "To find the semester with the most number of students registered, we can use a similar approach as before, but this time we will use the `MAX` aggregate function to find the maximum number of enrolled students for each semester.\n\nHere is the SQL query to find the semester with the most number of students registered:\n```\nSELECT s.semester_id, s.semester_name, COUNT(se.student_id) AS num_enrolled\nFROM Semesters s\nJOIN Student_Enrolment se ON s.semester_id = se.semester_id\nGROUP BY s.semester_id, s.semester_name\nORDER BY num_enrolled DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis query will return the `semester_id`, `semester_name`, and the number of enrolled students for each semester, sorted by the number of enrolled students in descending order.
