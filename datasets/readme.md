Stores datasets, such as `QAs_generate/datasets/cosql_dataset/database` and `QAs_generate/datasets/BIRD/dev/dev_databases`. The dataset organization should follow the format of [Spider](https://github.com/taoyds/spider).
# Recommended datasets

| Dataset | Description | Download Link |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Spider  | A large-scale complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL dataset | [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) |
| CoSQL   | A conversational text-to-SQL dataset | [CoSQL](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql) |
| SParC   | A cross-domain semantic parsing in context dataset | [SParC](https://yale-lily.github.io/sparc) |
| BIRD    | A Big Bench for Large-Scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs | [BIRD](https://bird-bench.github.io/) |

These datasets are organized in format compatible with our generation scripts.


âœ¨ We have organized higher quality [MMSQL train set](MMSQL_train.json) and test suites based on cosql and sparc with QDA-SQL generation results. Welcome to consider our [NEW WORK - MMSQL](https://github.com/mcxiaoxiao/MMSQL)!
